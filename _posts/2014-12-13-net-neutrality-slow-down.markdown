title: "Network Neutrality – Slow Down!"

In May, the FCC released a proposal asking the public which policy it should use to enforce net neutrality rules: Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, or Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, neither of these policies are good enough to protect the open internet.

## Losing Control

A few years before the recent ruling that stripped the FCC its ability to enforce net neutrality, the FCC was sued for not doing enough. In 2011, the FCC was [sued][FreePress] by a media reform group called Free Press. The suit was started because the FCC didn't do enough to enforce net neutrality rules on wireless networks. 

But now the FCC can't enforce net neutrality rules at all. In January 2014, Verizon led a [court case][Verizon] claiming that the FCC did not have the authority to enforce its network neutrality policy. The judges made a *unanimous* decision that the FCC did not have authority to enforce network neutrality under the policies it used.

And this isn't the first time the FCC was losing grip on net neutrality. It lost to a similar court case a few years ago.

## A Decision

As a result, the FCC released a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking][NPRM], where they ask the public to comment on how they will be affected by a given policy. From May 15th to September 10th[^1], the FCC asked the public to comment on whether the FCC should use Section 706 or Title II to enforce net neutrality. Which should they use? Neither.

### Section 706

In the proposal, FCC commissioner favors using Section 706 over Title II. However, one of the dissenting opinions, FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, has some convincing points on how Section 706 could do great harm to the internet. For example, there are problems with this policy that prevent it from applying all of the FCC's rules. The FCC's proposal even admits this!

> We seek comment on these suggestions, including whether all pay-for-priority practices, or some of them, could be treated as per se violations of the commercially reasonable standard or under any other standard based on any source of legal authority. We emphasize that **section 706 could not be used to reach some conduct** under this judicially recognized approach to circumvent the principle that the proposed rules will not, in any circumstances, constitute common carriage per se.
>
> --- [Protecting the Open Internet NPRM][NPRM], Paragraph 138

Emphasis mine. That last sentence is pretty difficult to parse, but in a nutshell the proposal is acknowledging that Section 706 doesn't protect the internet from the "slow lanes" that broadband providers have been pushing despite public opinion.

In addition, Section 706 grants the FCC unlimited authority to encourage broadband. This might sound pretty good at a glance, but don't be deceived. It has the potential to give just three people a great deal of power over the internet.

> So if three members of the FCC think that more Americans would go online if they knew their information would be secure, could we impose cybersecurity and encryption standards on website operators? If three members of the FCC think that more Americans would purchase broadband if edge providers were prohibited from targeted advertising, could we impose Do Not Track regulations? Or if three members of the FCC think that more Americans would use the Internet if there were greater privacy protections, could we follow the European Union and impose right-to-be-forgotten mandates?

You might think that seems like a stretch, but under Section 706, *so is net neutrality*. Also, Section 706 means that broadband providers may have to comply to different regulations in every state they operate them, which raises the barrier to entry for broadband competition. Broadband competition is bad enough as it is. Section 706 simply isn't meant for net neutrality.

### Title II

But Title II isn't the answer either. Like Section 706, it allows state regulators to set more policies and charge broadband providers, meaning broadband providers would have to pay regulatory charges to every state they operate in. This, again, raises the barrier to entry, limiting competition and innovation. 

It also increases regulatory costs for internet providers, which ends up raising costs for consumers and content providers. Just before the FCC released this proposal, 150 different recognizable internet companies [signed a letter][InternetCompanies] to the FCC asking, among other things, to "keep the costs of regulation low".

Title II is also so large that very little would or should apply to the internet. It is so big and clunky, in fact, that Google decided not to offer phone service as part of Google Fiber. FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly doesn't think Title II is for the job either:

> Even if the Commission granted forbearance from all of the provisions that it has eliminated for incumbent telephone companies--and then some--advocates are ignoring that broadband providers and services would still be subject to a host of unnecessary rules. The idea that the Commission can magically impose or sprinkle just the right amount of Title II on broadband providers is giving the Commission more credit than it ever deserves.

Of course, Michael O'Rielly doesn't agree with net neutrality at all, but that doesn't mean his point doesn't stand.

## The Solution

So if neither Section 706 nor Title II, what is the solution? The solution is to *slow down*. The FCC is rushing to make its decision because much of the public seems to think that the internet is falling apart, but it isn't. Additionally, two of five members of the commission, bipartisan, complained that they were making a rushed decision. Rather than rushing the decision, the FCC should do its research, or rather appoint experts to do some peer-reviewed research on what might be the best decision. In addition, the FCC should bring net neutrality to Congress. The internet is incredibly unique, not just a telephone network. Thus, it deserves its own set of laws that allows the FCC to better regulate it.

An advantage of this solution is that by taking their time and making sure they are able to enforce their policy, the policy is less likely to be struck down by judicial review, which will hopefully prevent this from happening again.
